# roomies

A roommate management app for cis197.

Users can sign up for an account and roommates should signup with the same group name. After logging in, all roommates in a group will have a shared interface where they can add items to a grocery list, schedule chores, and post to a message/announcement board.
Majority of functionality is in server.js, Home.js, Grocery.js, ChoreSchedule.js, and MessageBoard.js.
